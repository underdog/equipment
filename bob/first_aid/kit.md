# kit contents

Breaking up this doc into 4 different categories, as I've seen done on other
lists.

- bandages - these are smaller in nature, one size fits all type things.  Super
  useful to have for the small stuff.
- instruments - miscellaneous equipment that's "good to have"
- topicals & meds - ointments and internals
- wound dressings - more generic applicables for larger needs

I'll also try to tag each item if it would really only apply to a LARGE kit vs
a SMALL kit.  Sometimes you can't carry it all.

Lastly, I'm not a trained medical professional in anyway.  Following my advice
you'll probably die. Don't follow my advice.


## bandages

- various **small bandaids** (~40x) for scrapes and such. Especially useful
  if you're traveling with children. They're a psychological armor that can
  occur from having a bandaid.  sizes 2-4in in length.
- various **fabric bandages** (4-6x) are better for larger scrapes or burns
- **butterfly closures** (6-12x) for those larger cuts that need a bit more

## instruments

- **qtips** (~10x) or cotton tipped applicators. these are good for multiple
  situations
- **nitrile gloves** (~4, 2 of diff sizes)
- **sport tape** (roll of 1") putting this here because it's so useful for all
  sorts of things, including minor or larger wound management.  I like this
  better than the fabric tape that a lot of first aid kits include. It's
  tougher and stands up to getting wet a bit better.
- single use **instant cold pack** (1x)
- **needle and thread** good for splinters or sewing back on a button if needed
  or sewing up other things
- **medical scissors** if you've got room in your kit, these are nice to have
  if
  you need to quickly cut through clothing, etc
- **rapid tourniquet** if you really need it, you really need it. this folds up
  small so fits well

## topicals & medication

- **alcohol prep pad** (12x +) very useful for all sorts of situations. the
  small ones are fine
- **aetaminophen** tablets (16x +) this is useful for pain management. I also
  recommend adding more than you think you'll need. if the kit is accessible in
  a vehicle or whatnot, these will get used
- **diphenhydramine** (16x +) good for allergic reactions (name brand benadryl)
- **antibiotic ointment** (1x tube or multiple single use packets) very useful
  for keeping a small cut from turning into a larger infection
- **burn gel** (1x tube or multiple single use packets)
- **hydrocortisone cream** (1x tube or multiple single use packets)

## wound dressing

- **gauze pads** (6x)
- **asorbent compress dressings** (2x) 5 x 9 inches
- **crÃªpe rolled bandages** (2x) or ace wraps
- **safety pins** (10x) pin these through the cover of your first aid kit,
  you'll be surprised how they come in handy

## additional items to consider

- trach tube
- sharp pointed blade

The Red Cross has a good list that may be worth considering.
