Family Radio Service (FRS)
Family Radio Service (FRS)
The Family Radio Service is a license-free, private, two-way, very short-distance voice and data communications service for facilitating family and group activities. These frequencies are shared with the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS).

Note: A discrepancy has been noted with Federal documents as well as some FRS/GMRS radios, which list Channel 8 as 467.5675 MHz. Research with the FCC has shown that the correct frequency is 467.5625 in keeping with the 25kHz spacing of these and the GMRS frequencies (see Wiki for details).
